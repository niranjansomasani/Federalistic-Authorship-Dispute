Federal Paper Authorship Prediction:

The task of the project is to assign authorship for some of the federal papers that were open for debate.
There's already a code developed for the prediction but in R. Here's the link to that http://ptrckprry.com/course/ssd/lecture/federalist.html
The task here is to replicate and make improvements if possible using some great packages for text mining in python.
The code was developed in python as a part of some of my independent projects that I've done under Prof. Dberndt.

Federal_Authorship_Dispute : This notebook file has the code.

federalist.json : This is the data I've used for the analysis which's in JSON format.

For background reading, you can see the original article 'Mosteller_JASA1963Federalist' that I've uploaded.

Thanks!
